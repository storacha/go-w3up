# Implementation of DAG in Golang for Storacha go-w3up
##  Step 1 
### Adder Package Implementation 
The adder package provides functionality to add files and directories to content-addressed storage by chunking data, constructing a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), and integrating with a Mutable File System for retrieval. 
The [go-w3s-client](https://github.com/web3-storage/go-w3s-client) provides a reference implementation for building the DAG in this repo.
